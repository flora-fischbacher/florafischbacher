          <p>
            After many months of restaurant closures due to the COVID-19
            pandemic, experts predicted a drop in sales of 40 to 50 percent in
            the entire Austrian hospitality industry. Although many were able to
            help themselves by turning to delivery services and online ordering,
            major economic losses still remain in the hospitality industry.
            Additional costs due to new sanitary standards and the absence of
            tourists are jointly responsible for this. <br /><br />Due to the
            lockdowns and restrictions, technology has proven a necessary
            resource for restaurants to survive amid the pandemic.

          <p>
            Develop a digital experience (website or app) to help local
            restaurant owners to connect with local professionals willing to
            provide their skills and their time on a voluntary basis.
            <br /><br />Enable restaurants to find solutions to the many
            challenges they face. To connect them with people with professional
            skills who are ready to help.

        <p><b>Conducting interviews</b></p>
        <p>
          Once the research brief was complete, we began conducting interviews
          with people who fit our persona criteria. <br /><br />the interviews
          lasted between 50-60 minutes and we recieved a large amount of
          qualitative data.

        <p><b>Creating emapthy maps & user peronas</b></p>
        <p>
          With the information we gathered from the interviews, we were then
          able to create a rich empathy map so that all everything could be
          grouped into relevant categories. <br /><br /> Next we created the different
          user personas which would help us in the next steps of the project.

        <p><b>Formulating customer journies</b></p>
        <p>
          After we had our user personas, we began creating different customer
          journeys and user stories. These helped us to formulate various
          scenarios and think about how those challenges could be solved by
          different features of our app.

        <p>
          In this step, we conducted benchmarking research to identify what our
          competitors are doing, identifying industry best practices, and
          finding areas of improvement that we could implement into our product.

        <p>
          With all of the information that we gathered in the previous steps, it
          was finally time to create the value proposition canvas and define the
          MVP. By the end of this exercise, we were able to clearly answer the
          big question of "WHY" someone would want to use our product. <br /><br
          />This helped us to create the MVP and determine which core features
          must be added to the application.
