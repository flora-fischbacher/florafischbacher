          Restaurant Website & Online Ordering System
        </h4>
        <p>
          The objective of this project was to design and develop the website
          for Allegria. As it is a restaurant website, the most important design
          elements were the menu, photo gallery, and displaying customer
          reviews.
          <br /><br />
          Due to restaurant closures caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, we also implemented
          an online ordering service which became a highlight for the community.
